# PyBer Analysis

## Overview Of This Project
    - This project contains the rides data  of three different city types.

### Purpose 
      - The Purpose of this project is to analyze the summery data of per city   type and fares of each city type per week from January to April in multiple line chart form.
##  PyBer Result
      The Results of this Pyber analysis project can be discussed as follows.
        -In deliverable 1 we calculate the Pyber summary which contains the Total Fares,Total Rides,Total Drivers,Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver data.with the help of these calculated data we can clealy say that Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver ars low to Urban city type compared to Rural and Suburban even though Urban city has more number of rides and drivers. The Total Rides & drivers  are inversly proportional to  Average Fare per Ride & Average Fare per Drivers.we can observe the same from below screenshot.

        -In deliverable 2 we created the Multiple line chart of Weekly Fares of each city type.From this chart we can observe for Rural the wekkly price range is from 0 to 500 from january to april months and in april month it has highest fare.For Suburban the weekly price range is from 500 to 1500 from january to april and in the middle of february it has highest fare.For Urban the weekly price range is 1500 to 2500 from january to april and inthe middle of february and in early march it has highest fares.It clearly explains from the below image.

## PyBer Summary
     Based on the above results we can say If Rural decrease the Fare it can improve the number of rides so that number of drivers need can also be increased.For Urban the rides and drivers are more but the average fare per driver and ride is low.so,it has to work on to increase the average fare without decreasing the rides and driver number.For Suburban also needs to concentrate on icreasing the rides and driver number by increasing the average fare per ride and driver. Every city type has to concentrate on the reasons of weeks of lowest fares and the weeks of highest fare. So that every city type can improve the performance and revenue.
